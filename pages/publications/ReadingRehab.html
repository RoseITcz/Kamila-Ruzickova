<h2>Abstract</h2>
This book presents an emerging rehabilitation program for improving the reading abilities of individuals with low vision who undergo therapy for visual impairment. Its interdisciplinary framework for visual training through reading skills development aligns its goals with those of special education programs and features anatomical and psychological background chapters, diverse perspectives on rehabilitation, and empirical supporting data. Program details span theoretical bases, strategies and planning, pedagogical considerations, use of assistive technologies, and assessment of client progress and program efficacy. And by locating rehabilitation in the psychosocial experience of visual disability, the program can be used as a means of building confidence and motivation, contributing to improved quality of life.
